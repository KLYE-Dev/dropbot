A simple self hosted token giveaway bot for Hive-Engine.com tokens.

By utilizing the initiation command DropBot will begin monitoring any post the deployer has performed the command in. By deploying this application once the installation of dependencies has been completed you'll be able to run it to unlock the ability to morph any simple HIVE blog post into an automated token giveaway event of your design. By specifying different variables including but not limited to the token to be given away and the amount of said token to be given away you'll soon have the power to distribute your Hive-Engine.com tokens without even so much as having to refresh a post.
